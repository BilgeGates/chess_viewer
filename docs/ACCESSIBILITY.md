## Overview

This document honestly describes the accessibility status of Chess Diagram Generator based on actual implementation.

### Reality Check
- ❌ **No WCAG compliance testing done**
- ✅ Basic browser keyboard navigation works
- ❌ No custom accessibility features implemented
- ⚠️ Minimal screen reader support (just semantic HTML)
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Color customization available

---

## What Actually Exists

### 1. Browser Default Keyboard Navigation
The standard browser keyboard shortcuts work:
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Navigate between elements
- `Enter` - Click buttons/links
- `Space` - Toggle checkboxes, click buttons
- `Esc` - Close modals (if implemented in modal component)

**No custom keyboard shortcuts exist.**

### 2. Semantic HTML
Basic HTML tags are used:
```jsx
<main>
  <button>...</button>
  <input type="text" />
  <select>...</select>
</main>
```

**No ARIA attributes implemented.**

### 3. Responsive Design
- Built with Tailwind CSS
- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices

### 4. Canvas Board Rendering
- HTML5 Canvas for chess board
- High-quality rendering
- Export up to 12,800×12,800px

### 5. Color Customization
- Multiple board themes
- Custom color picker
- Users can adjust board colors

### 6. Dependencies
Based on `package.json`:
```json
{
  "react": "^19.2.3",
  "react-dom": "^19.2.3",
  "react-router-dom": "^7.11.0",
  "lucide-react": "^0.562.0",
  "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.3.5"
}
```

**No accessibility-specific libraries installed** (no axe-core, no Pa11y, no ARIA testing tools).

## Known Issues

### Critical Accessibility Problems

1. **Canvas is Not Accessible**
   - Screen readers cannot read the chess board
   - No text alternative provided
   - Visually impaired users cannot understand board position

2. **No Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Users must tab through all UI elements

3. **Minimal Screen Reader Support**
   - Most interactive elements lack labels
   - No status announcements

   - No visual or audio feedback during export
   - Screen readers don't announce completion
   - Users don't know when export finishes

5. **Color Contrast Unknown**
   - No testing done for WCAG compliance
   - Classic chess colors likely below AA standard
   - No contrast checker implemented

6. **No Focus Indicators**
   - Using browser defaults only
   - May be hard to see on some themes
   - No custom, high-visibility focus ring

## Testing Status

### What's Been Tested
- ⚠️ Manual testing on desktop Chrome only
- ⚠️ Basic responsive testing on mobile

### What Hasn't Been Tested
- ❌ No screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- ❌ No keyboard-only navigation testing
- ❌ No color contrast testing
- ❌ No automated accessibility audits
- ❌ No testing with assistive technologies
- ❌ No WCAG compliance verification

### Testing Tools NOT Used
```bash
# These are NOT installed or configured:
# - @axe-core/react
# - pa11y
# - pa11y-ci
# - lighthouse (not in CI)
# - jest-axe
```

## Future Plans

### If We Add Accessibility (Planned)

#### Phase 1: Basic (Easy to Add)
1. Add ARIA labels to all buttons
2. Add `sr-only` utility class
3. Add basic screen reader text for canvas
4. Add simple keyboard shortcuts
5. Add custom focus styles

#### Phase 2: Medium (More Work)
1. Implement focus management in modals
2. Add status announcements (aria-live)
3. Create FEN position descriptions
4. Add high contrast theme
5. Support `prefers-reduced-motion`

#### Phase 3: Advanced (Major Effort)
1. SVG board option (better than canvas for accessibility)
2. Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. Comprehensive screen reader support
4. Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
5. Voice control support

## Honest Summary

### What Works
✅ Basic HTML structure is semantic  
✅ Standard browser keyboard navigation  
✅ Responsive layout  
✅ Works on mobile and desktop  
✅ Color customization helps some users  

### What Doesn't Work
❌ Canvas board is completely inaccessible  
❌ No screen reader support  
❌ No keyboard shortcuts  
❌ No ARIA labels  
❌ No accessibility testing  
❌ No WCAG compliance  

### Bottom Line
**This app is built for sighted users who use a mouse or touchscreen.**

Users who rely on:
- Screen readers: **Will have major difficulties**
- Keyboard-only navigation: **Will be inconvenienced**
- High contrast: **May struggle with default colors**
- Assistive technologies: **Limited or no support**

**We acknowledge these limitations and plan to improve accessibility in future versions.**
